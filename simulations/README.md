# Simulating sequence data and metadata for epidemic spread between 3 demes

This workflow simulates a simple sequence alignment (FASTA file) and a metadata file (csv file) from an SEIR epidemic spreading in a structured population composed of 3 subgroups (A, B, and C).
The metadata file describes the sequence label, sampling time and the subgroup of each sampled individual. 

The simulations output can be found at:
- [`results/simulated_alignment.fasta`]() for the simulated sequence alignment
- [`results/simulated_metadata.csv`]() for the corresponding simulated metadata
